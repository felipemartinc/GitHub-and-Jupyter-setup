You can make _italicized_ by adding an asterisk or underscore before and after it (e.g.,  `_Jupyter Notebooks are great!_`). Want text in **bold**? Add two asterisks before and after the text (e.g., `**my bold text**`).  \n",

For example, the statement `import math` will make Python's math library available in our Notebook. The library lives in what is called a _module_. Think of it as a container filled with lots of math functions and constants. We have use what's called _dot notation_ to access the functions inside the module.
