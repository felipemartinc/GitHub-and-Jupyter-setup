You're used to formatting text by clicking on words or phrases and then selecting a format, e.g., bold, italic, Header, etc. In Markdown, you don't do apply formats this way: Instead, we add special codes to the text to specify the way it should appear.`\n",

    "For example, the first line in this document is a heading. To make it appear large, we add a number sign before (e.g., `# Intro to Human-Centered Data Science`). You can make _italicized_ by adding an asterisk or underscore before and after it (e.g.,  `_Jupyter Notebooks are great!_`). Want text in **bold**? Add two asterisks before and after the text (e.g., `**my bold text**`).  \n",

For example, the statement `import math` will make Python's math library available in our Notebook. The library lives in what is called a _module_. Think of it as a container filled with lots of math functions and constants. We have use what's called _dot notation_ to access the functions inside the module.
